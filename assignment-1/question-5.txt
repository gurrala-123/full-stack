question-5

ans: The term Web service (WS) is a service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other.  In a Web service a Web technology such as HTTP—originally designed for human-to-machine communication is used for transferring  other.machine-readable file formats such as XML and JSON.Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architecture for well-behaved Web services that can function at Internet scale.A Web API is a development in Web services where emphasis has been moving to simpler representational  state transfer (REST) based communications.Restful APIs do not require XML-based Web service protocols (SOAP and WSDL) to support their interfaces.Once the software system finds out which other systems it should contact, it would then contact that system using a special protocol called SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol). The service provider system would first validate the data request by referring to the WSDL file, and  then process the request and send the data under the SOAP protocol. SOAP ,REST they’re inherently different technologies and aren’t easily compared on a granular level Because SOAP is a protocol, and REST is an architectural style. A REST API can actually utilize the SOAP protocol, just like it can use HTTP. So, right off the bat, they’re going to be packaged differently, function differently, and be used in different scenarios.REST (Representational State Transfer) is truly a “web services” API. REST APIs are based on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifier, of which a URL  is a specific type) and the HTTP protocol, and use JSON for a data format, which is super browser-compatible. (It could also theoretically use  the SOAP protocol, as we mentioned above.) REST APIs can be simple to build and scale, but they can also be massive and complicated—it’s all in how  they’re built, added on to, and what they’re designed to do.
